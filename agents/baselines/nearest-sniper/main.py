"""
Orbit Wars - Nearest Planet Sniper Agent

A simple agent that captures the nearest unowned planet when it has
enough ships to guarantee the takeover.

Strategy:
  For each planet we own, find the closest planet we don't own.
  If we have more ships than the target's garrison, send exactly
  enough to capture it (garrison + 1). Otherwise, wait and accumulate.

Key concepts demonstrated:
  - Parsing the observation (planets, player ID)
  - Computing angles with atan2 for fleet direction
  - Sending moves as [from_planet_id, angle, num_ships]
